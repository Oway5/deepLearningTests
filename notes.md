From some data manipulation, I think setting the minimum sponsor vote threshold to 50 would be a good idea.
We could expand later based on how training goes. With a dataset min of 50 votes we still have to scrape about **11,000** unique videos. Now we need to figure out how to do that...
For our initial *test* we should probably raise the bar to something super high just to ensure a perfect sponsor detection scenario.
